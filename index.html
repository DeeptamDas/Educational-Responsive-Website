    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. 
        Its precise definition is disputed and there are disagreements about what the aims of education are and to what extent 
        education is different from indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements affect how to identify, 
        measure, and improve forms of education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental states and qualities of 
        educated people and the academic field studying educational phenomena

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or preceptor after 
        initiation.[34] The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between the Guru and his Shishya 
        (students /disciples) was a very important part of education.[35] Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of 
        the example of ancient higher learning institute in India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is debatable 
        whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official 
        membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential 
        quarters in a Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system
         of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in the Pali language.

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A teaching method is a set of principles and methods used by teachers to enable student 
        learning. These strategies are determined partly on subject matter to be taught and partly by the nature of the learner. 
        For a particular teaching method to be appropriate and efficient it has take into account the learner, the nature of the 
        subject matter, and the type of learning it is supposed to bring about.</p>
